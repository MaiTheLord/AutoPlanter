In order for the Auto Planter to plant, you need to place seeds, beetroot seeds, potatoes, carrots or nether warts in the Auto Planter.

After a few seconds the Auto Planter will start to plant the crops in a radius of a few blocks from it, on Farmland or Soul Sand blocks placed one block below its height.
